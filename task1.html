    <h1 id="chapter2">Apj Abdul Kalam</h1>
    <p>
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/ˈəbdʊl kəˈlɑːm/ ⓘ; 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian
        aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. Born and raised
        in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next
        four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
        Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's
        civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile
        Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He
        also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
        the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]

        Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata
        Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President",[6] he
        returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient
        of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

        While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an
        apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.[7] Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended
        the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.[8]<br>

        Early life and education<br>
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage
        centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His
        father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a
        housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram
        and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15]

        Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy
        Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim
        ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women.<br>
        The family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri
        Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to
        the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the
        1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy
        he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income. [19][20][21]

        In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a
        strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics.[21] After completing his
        education at Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend the St. Joseph's College,
        Tiruchirappalli from where he graduated in Physics in 1954.[22]

        Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.[13] While Kalam
        was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to
        revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline,
        impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult
        deadline."[23] He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in
        qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.[24]

        Career as a scientist<br>
        This was my first stage, in which I learnt leadership from three great teachers—Dr Vikram Sarabhai, Prof Satish
        Dhawan and Dr Brahm Prakash. This was the time of learning and acquisition of knowledge for me.

        A P J Abdul Kalam[25]<br>

        After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development
        Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of
        India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started
        his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam
        joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed and
        recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station
        (TERLS).[27] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the
        project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini
        satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project
        independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme
        to include more engineers.[25]

        In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in
        Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.[11][28] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to
        develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be
        successful.<br>

        Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the
        representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also
        directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the
        technology of the successful SLV programme.[29] Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister
        Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's
        directorship.[29] Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these
        classified aerospace projects.[29] His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and
        prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his
        directorship.[29] Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister,
        worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous
        development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another.[30] R Venkatraman was
        instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating ₹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated
        Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.[30] Kalam played a
        major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile
        and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for
        mismanagement and cost and time overruns.[30][31]

    <p>
        Swami Vivekananda (/ˈswɑːmi ˌvɪveɪˈkɑːnəndə/; Bengali: [ʃami bibekanɔndo] ⓘ; IAST: Svāmī Vivekānanda ; 12
        January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta (Bengali: [nɔrendronatʰ dɔto]), was an Indian Hindu monk,
        philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the Indian mystic Ramakrishna.[4][5] He was a
        key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world,[6][7][8] and is the father of modern
        Indian nationalism who is credited with raising interfaith awareness and bringing Hinduism to the status of a
        major world religion in the late nineteenth century.[9]<br>

        Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards
        religion and spirituality. He later found his guru Ramakrishna and became a monk. After the death of
        Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively toured the Indian subcontinent as a wandering monk and acquired first-hand
        knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in then British India. Moved by their plight, he resolved to
        help them and found a way to travel to the United States, where he became a popular figure after the 1893
        Parliament of Religions in Chicago at which he delivered his famous speech beginning with the words: "Sisters
        and brothers of America ..." while introducing Hinduism to Americans.[10][11] He made such an impression there
        that an American newspaper described him as "an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at
        the Parliament".[12]<br>

        After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures
        across the United States, England, and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded
        the Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco (now Vedanta Society of Northern
        California),[13] both of which became the foundations for Vedanta Societies in the West. In India, he founded
        the Ramakrishna Math, which provides spiritual training for monastics and householders, and the Ramakrishna
        Mission, which provides charity, social work and education.[7]<br>

        Vivekananda was one of the most influential philosophers and social reformers in his contemporary India, and the
        most successful missionary of Vedanta to the Western world. He was also a major force in contemporary Hindu
        reform movements and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India.[14] He is now widely regarded
        as one of the most influential people of modern India and a patriotic saint. His birthday in India is celebrated
        as National Youth Day.[15][16]<br <br>

        <br>
        Statue of Vivekananda at the Ramakrishna Mission Swami Vivekananda's Ancestral House and Cultural Centre
        Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta (name shortened to Narendra or Naren)[18] in a Bengali Kayastha
        family[19][20] in his ancestral home at 3 Gourmohan Mukherjee Street in Calcutta,[21] the capital of British
        India, on 12 January 1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival.[22] He belonged to a traditional family and was
        one of nine siblings.[23] His father, Vishwanath Datta, was an attorney at the Calcutta High Court.[19][24]<br>
        Durgacharan Datta, Narendra's grandfather was a Sanskrit and Persian scholar[25] who left his family and became
        a monk at age twenty-five.[26] His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife.[25] The progressive,
        rational attitude of Narendra's father and the religious temperament of his mother helped shape his thinking and
        personality.[27][28] Narendranath was interested in spirituality from a young age and used to meditate before
        the images of deities such as Shiva, Rama, Sita, and Mahavir Hanuman.[29] He was fascinated by wandering
        ascetics and monks.[28] Narendra was mischievous and restless as a child, and his parents often had difficulty
        controlling him. His mother said, "I prayed to Shiva for a son and he has sent me one of his demons".
        <br>
        Education
        In 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution,
        where he went to school until his family moved to Raipur in 1877.[30] In 1879, after his family's return to
        Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the Presidency College entrance
        examination. [31] He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, religion, history,
        social science, art and literature.[32] He was also interested in Hindu scriptures, including the Vedas, the
        Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas. Narendra was trained in Indian
        classical music,[33] and regularly participated in physical exercise, sports and organised activities.<br>
        Narendra studied Western logic, Western philosophy and European history at the General Assembly's Institution
        (now known as the Scottish Church College).[34] In 1881, he passed the Fine Arts examination, and completed a
        Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884.[35][36] Narendra studied the works of David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Johann
        Gottlieb Fichte, Baruch Spinoza, Georg W. F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Auguste Comte, John Stuart Mill and
        Charles Darwin.<br>He became fascinated with the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer and corresponded with
        him,[39][40] translating Herbert Spencer's book Education (1861) into Bengali.[41] While studying Western
        philosophers, he also learned Sanskrit scriptures and Bengali literature.[38]<br>

    <h1 id="chapter4">JHansi lakshmi bai</h1>
    <p>
        Lakshmibai Newalkar, the Rani of Jhansi (pronunciationⓘ; born Manikarnika Tambe; 19 November 1828 — 18 June
        1858),[1][2] was the Maharani consort of the princely state of Jhansi in the Maratha Empire from 1843 to 1853 by
        marriage to Maharaja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar. She was one of the leading figures in the Indian Rebellion of 1857,
        who became a national hero and symbol of resistance to the British rule in India for Indian nationalists.
        <br>
        Born into a Karhada Brahmin family in Banares, Lakshmibai married the Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao, in
        1842. When the Maharaja died in 1853, the British East India Company under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie
        refused to recognize the claim of his adopted heir and annexed Jhansi under the Doctrine of Lapse. The Rani was
        unwilling to cede control and joined the rebellion against the British in 1857. She led the successful defense
        of Jhansi against Company allies, but in early 1858 Jhansi fell to British forces under the command of Hugh
        Rose. The Rani managed to escape on horseback and joined the rebels in capturing Gwalior, where they proclaimed
        Nana Saheb as Peshwa of the revived Maratha Empire. She died in June 1858 after being mortally wounded during
        the British counterattack at Gwalior.
        <br>
        Early life
        <br>
        A miniature portrait of Rani Lakshmibai
        Rani Lakshmibai (or Rani Lakshmi Bai) was born on 19 November 1828[3][4] (some sources say 1835)[2][5][6] in the
        town of Banares (now Varanasi) into a Marathi Karhade Brahmin family.[7] She was named Manikarnika Tambe and was
        nicknamed Manu.[8] Her father was Moropant Tambe[9] and her mother Bhagirathi Sapre (Bhagirathi Bai). Her
        parents came from the Tambe village of the Guhagar taluka located in the Ratnagiri district of modern-day
        Maharashtra.[10] Her mother died when she was five years old. Her father was a Commander during the war of
        Kalyanpranth. Her father worked for Peshwa Baji Rao II of Bithoor district.[11] The Peshwa called her
        "Chhabili", which means "beautiful " and "lively and cheerful".<br> She was educated at home and was taught to
        read
        and write, and was more independent in her childhood than others of her age; her studies included shooting,
        horsemanship, fencing[12][13] and mallakhamba with her childhood friends Nana Sahib and Tantia
        Tope.[14][15][dubious – discuss] Rani Lakshmibai contrasted many of the patriarchal cultural expectations for
        women in India's society at this time.[16] And she was known for her unique perspectives and her courage to
        fight against social norms even in front of the whole society.
        <br>
        Rani Lakshmibai was accustomed to riding on horseback accompanied by escorts between the palace and the temple,
        although sometimes she was carried in a palanquin.[17] Her horses included Sarangi, Pavan and Baadal; according
        to historians, she rode Baadal when escaping from the fort in 1858. Her palace, the Rani Mahal, has now been
        converted into a museum. It houses a collection of archaeological remains of the period between the 9th and 12th
        centuries AD.
        <br>
        History of Jhansi, 1842 – May 1857
        <br>
        1859 drawing titled The Ranee of Jhansi depicting Lakshmibai smoking hookah
        Manikarnika was married to the Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao Newalkar, in May 1842[3][18] and was afterward
        called Lakshmibai (or Laxmibai) in honor of the Hindu goddess Devi Lakshmi and according to the Maharashtrian
        tradition of women being given a new name after marriage. In September 1851, she gave birth to a boy, later
        named Damodar Rao, who died four months after birth due to a chronic illness. The Maharaja adopted a child
        called Anand Rao, the son of Gangadhar Rao's cousin, who was renamed Damodar Rao, on the day before the Maharaja
        died.[19] The adoption was in the presence of the British political officer who was given a letter from the
        Maharaja instructing that the child be treated with respect and that the government of Jhansi should be given to
        his widow for her lifetime.
        <br>
        After the death of the Maharaja in November 1853, because Damodar Rao (born Anand Rao) was an adopted son, the
        British East India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied the Doctrine of Lapse, rejecting
        Damodar Rao's claim to the throne and annexing the state to its territories. When she was informed of this she
        cried out "Main apni Jhansi nahi doongi" (I shall not surrender my Jhansi). In March 1854, Rani Lakshmibai was
        given an annual pension of Rs. 60,000 and ordered to leave the palace and the fort.[20][21]
        <br>
        According to Vishnu Bhatt Godse, the Rani would exercise at weightlifting, wrestling, and steeplechasing before
        breakfast. An intelligent and simply-dressed woman, she ruled in a businesslike manner.[22]
        <br>
        The Revolt of 1857
        Beginning of the Rebellion
        <br>
        Lachmi Bai, the Joan of Arc of India, by Michael White
        On 10 May 1857, the Indian Rebellion started in Meerut. When news of the rebellion reached Jhansi, the Rani
        asked the British political officer, Captain Alexander Skene, for permission to raise a body of armed men for
        her protection; Skene agreed to this.[23] The city was relatively calm amid the regional unrest in the summer of
        1857, but the Rani conducted a Haldi Kumkum ceremony with pomp in front of all the women of Jhansi to provide
        assurance to her subjects, and to convince them that the British were cowards and not to be afraid of
        them.[24][25]<br>

        Until this point, Lakshmi Bai was reluctant to rebel against the British. In June 1857, rebels of the 12th
        Bengal Native Infantry seized the Star Fort of Jhansi, containing the treasure and magazine,[26] and after
        persuading the British to lay down their arms by promising them no harm, broke their word and massacred 40 to 60
        European officers of the garrison along with their wives and children. The Rani's involvement in this massacre
        is still a subject of debate.[27][28] An army doctor, Thomas Lowe, wrote after the rebellion characterizing her
        as the "Jezebel of India ... the young rani upon whose head rested the blood of the slain".[29]<br>


        The Rani of Jhansi's seal
        Four days after the massacre the sepoys left Jhansi, having obtained a large sum of money from the Rani, and
        having threatened to blow up the palace where she lived. Following this, as the only source of authority in the
        city the Rani felt obliged to assume the administration and wrote to Major Erskine, commissioner of the Saugor
        division explaining the events which had led her to do so.[30] On 2 July, Erskine wrote in reply, requesting her
        to "manage the District for the British Government" until the arrival of a British Superintendent.[31] The
        Rani's forces defeated an attempt by the mutineers to assert the claim to the throne of a rival prince Sadashiv
        Rao (nephew of Maharaja Gangadhar Rao) who was captured and imprisoned.<br>

        There was then an invasion of Jhansi by the forces of Company allies Orchha and Datia; their intention however
        was to divide Jhansi between themselves. The Rani appealed to the British for aid but it was now believed by the
        governor-general that she was responsible for the massacre and no reply was received. She set up a foundry to
        cast cannon to be used on the walls of the fort and assembled forces including some from former feudatories of
        Jhansi and elements of the mutineers which were able to defeat the invaders in August 1857. Her intention at
        this time was still to hold Jhansi on behalf of the British.[32]

    <h1 id="chapter5">Bhagat sing</h1>
    <p>
        Bhagat Singh (28 September 1907[1] – 23 March 1931) was an Indian anti-colonial revolutionary,[3] who
        participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in December 1928[4] in what was to be
        retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.[5] He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the
        Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in
        Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23
        into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.[6] Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism,[7] the
        charismatic Singh[8] electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent introspection
        within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India's independence.<br>

        In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, both members of a small revolutionary group,
        the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old British police
        officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on
        probation, for the British senior police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate.[10]
        They held Scott responsible for the death of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai for having
        ordered a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai was injured and two weeks thereafter died of a heart attack. As
        Saunders exited a police station on a motorcycle, he was felled by a single bullet fired from across the street
        by Rajguru, a marksman.[11][12] As he lay injured, he was shot at close range several times by Singh, the
        postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds.[13] Another associate of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead
        an Indian police head constable, Channan Singh, who attempted to give chase as Singh and Rajguru fled.[11][12]<br>

        After having escaped, Bhagat Singh and his associates used pseudonyms to publicly announce avenging Lajpat Rai's
        death, putting up prepared posters that they had altered to show John Saunders as their intended target instead
        of James Scott.[11] Singh was thereafter on the run for many months, and no convictions resulted at the time.
        Surfacing again in April 1929, he and another associate, Batukeshwar Dutt, set off two low-intensity homemade
        bombs among some unoccupied benches of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi. They showered leaflets from
        the gallery on the legislators below, shouted slogans, and allowed the authorities to arrest them.[14] The
        arrest, and the resulting publicity, brought to light Singh's complicity in the John Saunders case. Awaiting
        trial, Singh gained public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike, demanding
        better prison conditions for Indian prisoners, the strike ending in Das's death from starvation in September
        1929.<br>

        Bhagat Singh was convicted of the murder of John Saunders and Channan Singh, and hanged in March 1931, aged 23.
        He became a popular folk hero after his death. Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about him: "Bhagat Singh did not become
        popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala
        Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol; the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and
        within a few months each town and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India,
        resounded with his name."[15] In still later years, Singh, an atheist and socialist in adulthood, won admirers
        in India from among a political spectrum that included both communists and right-wing Hindu nationalists.
        Although many of Singh's associates, as well as many Indian anti-colonial revolutionaries, were also involved in
        daring acts and were either executed or died violent deaths, few came to be lionised in popular art and
        literature as did Singh, who is sometimes referred to as the Shaheed-e-Azam ("Great martyr" in Urdu and
        Punjabi).[16]<br>

        Early life
        Bhagat Singh was born into a Punjabi Jat Sikh[17] family on 27 September 1907[1] in the village of Banga in the
        Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and is today Pakistan; he was the second of seven
        children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu.[18] Bhagat
        Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation around
        the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915.[18]<br>

        After being sent to the village school in Banga for a few years, Bhagat Singh was enrolled in the Dayanand
        Anglo-Vedic School in Lahore.[18] In 1923, he joined the National College in Lahore, founded two years earlier
        by Lala Lajpat Rai in response to Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement, which urged Indian students to shun
        schools and colleges subsidized by the British Indian government.[18]<br>

        Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested him in May 1927 on the pretext that he had
        been involved in a bombing that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926. He was released on a surety of Rs.
        60,000 five weeks after his arrest.[19] He wrote for, and edited, Urdu and Punjabi newspapers, published in
        Amritsar[20] and also contributed to low-priced pamphlets published by the Naujawan Bharat Sabha that excoriated
        the British.[21] He also wrote for Kirti, the journal of the Kirti Kisan Party ("Workers and Peasants Party")
        and briefly for the Veer Arjun newspaper, published in Delhi.[22][a] He often used pseudonyms, including names
        such as Balwant, Ranjit and Vidhrohi.[24]<br>
